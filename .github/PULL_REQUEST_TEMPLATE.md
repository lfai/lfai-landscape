### Pre-submission checklist:

*Please check each of these after submitting your pull request:*

* [ ] Are you including a `repo_url`? You need to pick the single best GitHub repository for your project, not a GitHub organization.
* [ ] Is your project open source?
* [ ] Have you picked the single best (existing) category for your project?
* [ ] Have you added the SVG for your logo to `hosted_logos` and referenced it in the entry in `landscape.yml`?
* [ ] Have you verified that the Crunchbase data for your organization (including headquarters and LinkedIn) is correct?
* [ ] Does it follow the other guidelines from the [new entries](https://github.com/lfai/lfai-landscape#new-entries) section?
* [ ] ~5 minutes after opening the pull request, there will be a link to preview the entry on the staging server. Have you confirmed that it looks good?
