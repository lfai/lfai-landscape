                Apache Arrow is a cross-language development platform for in-memory data. It specifies a standardized language-independent columnar memory
                format for flat and hierarchical data, organized for efficient analytic operations on modern hardware. It also provides computational libraries
                and zero-copy streaming messaging and interprocess communication. Languages currently supported include C, C++, Java, JavaScript, Python, and
                Ruby.
